    "When dealing with discrete optics such as spatial light modulators, the discretization imposes Nyquist sampling constraints similar to digital signal processing. The Nyquist sampling limit requires sampling at twice the largest spatial frequency. The largest spatial frequency is estimated by the maximum of the the derivative of the phase function with respect to the spatial coordinates, i.e.,\n",
